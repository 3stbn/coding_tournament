Specs

Render a Google Map component that let you click on certain points on the map to retrieve the location information and also click on displayed items that show the detailed information of an event.
Form to create an event with the following fields:
- Description (Text field)
- Type of event (Relationship to a table of type of events)
- Date and time of the event (default value is current time, but user can select a different date from the past)
- Location (User should click on map to get location - latitude,longitude -)
- Image
The main view of the app should be the map that is zoomed automatically to show all events displayed in the map.
As a user I should be able to filter the events by type of event or point in time ( all, today, last week, last month, last year)
There should be a button to report an event, clicking on it should open the form to create an event (Panel should slide from right, open in a modal or something else, be creative!)
Clicking on an event in the map it will display the rest of the information of the event.
There should be a Feed sidebar that displays the last 10 events in realtime with option to load more

Extra Points:
- Clusters of points in map?
- Retrieve user current location
- Good design (Use Material Design, Semantic-UI, Bootstrap, etc)
